Hey y’all! Hope you’re doing good! If you don’t have some tea in front of you right now, stop reading and go brew some! Today I’m sipping on some Tai Ping Hou Kui that I just got - review coming soon, so I won’t blab about it. 

**Just wanted to let everyone know about some tea related apps I’ve created:**
 
**[TeaBuddy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.willjane.teabuddy&hl=en_CA)**, a tea companion app on Android

**[Gongfu Tea Timer](https://github.com/williamxyshi/GongfuTeaTimer)**, a Gongfu tea timer app I threw together for a user on r/tea

**[teagether](https://github.com/williamxyshi/teagether)**, a work in progress video chat app for hosting and joining tea parties!

That's it! Thanks for reading :)
